Find projects that contain the file "refresh-resume.js"

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll search for projects that contain the file "refresh-resume.js". Let me use the file search tool to find all instances of this file. Based on the search results, I found one project that contains the file "refresh-resume.js":

**Project:** ``
- **File location:** `refresh-resume.js`

This appears to be a resume refresh API project, likely built for Vercel deployment (based on the presence of `vercel.json` in the project structure). The file is located in the `` directory, which is a common pattern for Vercel serverless functions.

Would you like me to examine the contents of this file or search for any other related files in your workspace?
