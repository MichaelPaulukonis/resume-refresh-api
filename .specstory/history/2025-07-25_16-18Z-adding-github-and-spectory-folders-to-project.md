# Adding .github and .spectory folders to project (2025-07-25 16:18Z)

_**User**_

I've added the .github folder with copilot-instructions, as well as .spectory chat history. These will be ignore by vercel, as it deployes according to the vercel.json file, which specifies the `api` folder. Please create a commit message for these additions.

`docs(config): add .github and .spectory files for copilot and chat history`

This commit message:
- Uses the `docs` type to indicate documentation/configuration changes
- Specifies the `config` scope to show these are setup files
- Clearly describes the addition of both folders while respecting their purpose
- Follows conventional commit format while being concise and descriptive
