# Issues in resume-rewriter API implementation (2025-07-25 19:27Z)

_**User**_

This is the backend API for a resume-rewriter application. It will take in some values from the user (jobTitle, industry, resumeText, jobDescription, relevantExperience), combine with various prompt templates (`template.js`), pass them over to OpenAI, and return the result to the user (front-end application). I've just added the `prompt.js` and `template.js` code. This should be pretty simple template-string conjunction. Do you see any issues with the two files?

---

_**Assistant**_

The current implementation has two critical issues:

1. **Missing Import for Certifications**  
   The prompt template references `${certifications}` but the import statement in `prompt.js` doesn't include it. This will throw an error at runtime.

2. **Unused Parameters in Prompt**  
   `jobDescription` and `relevantExperience` are accepted as function parameters but never used in the prompt string. This breaks the intended functionality of tailoring resumes to specific job descriptions and experience.

---

### Fixes

1. **Update Import in `prompt.js`**  
   Add `certifications` to the import list:
   ```javascript
   // filepath: /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/UPWORK/resume-refresh-api/api/prompt.js
   import { system, summary, skills, experience, education, certifications } from './templates.js'
   ```

2. **Incorporate Unused Parameters**  
   Modify the prompt to include `jobDescription` and `relevantExperience`:
   ```javascript
   // filepath: /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/UPWORK/resume-refresh-api/api/prompt.js
   const buildPrompt = (jobTitle, industry, resumeText, jobDescription, relevantExperience) => {
     const prompt = `
   You are a professional resume writer. Rewrite the resume below for a role as a ${jobTitle} in the ${industry} industry. Use modern, ATS-friendly formatting and results-oriented language. Improve clarity, impact, and relevance.

   === TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION ===
   ${jobDescription}
   === RESUME START ===
   ${resumeText}
   === RESUME END ===

   Focus on:
   - Aligning with keywords from the job description
   - Highlighting ${relevantExperience} relevant to this role

   Organize the resume as follows:
   1. SUMMARY
   2. SKILLS
   3. EXPERIENCE
   4. EDUCATION
   5. CERTIFICATIONS

   Do not add introductory or concluding commentary - return only the resume.

   ${summary}

   ${skills}

   ${experience}

   ${education}

   ${certifications}
   `
     return { system, user: prompt }
   }
   ```

<think><think>
Okay, let me take another look at the user's code after they've made the changes. The previous issues were the missing certifications import and unused parameters. Now, the import seems fixed because certifications are included in the import statement. The jobDescription and relevantExperience variables are used in the prompt, so that's good.

Wait, but in the prompt template, the Focus on section uses a conditional for the Aligning with keywords line. The user's code checks if jdPrompt is truthy, which depends on jobDescription being present. However, the way the prompt is structured, the jdPrompt is added as a block, but the Focus section's conditional might not work correctly if jobDescription is empty. Because if jobDescription is not provided, jdPrompt would be an empty string, so the conditional in Focus would evaluate to false, and that line would be omitted. But the user's code currently has:

Focus on:
${ !!jdPrompt ? '- Aligning with keywords from the job description' : ''}
- Highlighting experience relevant to this role

But jdPrompt is only created if jobDescription exists. However, the prompt is built with ${jdPrompt} which includes the entire block if jobDescription is present. But in the Focus section, the first line is conditional on jdPrompt being truthy. Wait, no. Because jdPrompt is a string that's either the full block or an empty string. So, if jobDescription is provided, jdPrompt is a non-empty string, so !!jdPrompt would be true. If jobDescription is not provided, jdPrompt is an empty string, so !!jdPrompt would be false. Therefore, the Aligning line would only appear if jobDescription is present. That makes sense because if there's no job description, there's no need to align keywords. So that part is okay.

Another thing to check: the relevantExperience parameter. The rePrompt variable is added to the prompt if relevantExperience exists. The Focus section has a line that says "- Highlighting experience relevant to this role" regardless of whether relevantExperience is provided. But maybe that line should also be conditional? Wait, the user's code currently has:

- Highlighting experience relevant to this role

This line is static. However, if relevantExperience is provided, the rePrompt block is added. The Focus section's line about highlighting experience is always present. But maybe that's okay because even if there's no specific relevantExperience, the system should still highlight existing experience in the resume. The relevantExperience parameter is additional info to reference, but the main instruction to highlight relevant experience is always needed. So perhaps that line should remain regardless. The user's code now includes it, so maybe that's intended.

Now, looking at the prompt structure. The jdPrompt is inserted as a block, and the rePrompt as well. Then, the Focus section includes the conditional line for Aligning keywords and the static line for highlighting experience. The prompt then includes the resumeText, and the template sections.

Wait, but in the prompt, after the jdPrompt and rePrompt, the resume is enclosed between === RESUME START === and === RESUME END ===. Then, the Focus section mentions aligning keywords if jdPrompt is present. That seems correct.

Another potential issue: the prompt ends with the template sections (summary, skills, etc.), but the way the prompt is structured, the model is supposed to generate the resume sections based on the instructions. However, the current prompt includes the actual template strings, which might not be necessary. Wait, looking at the code, the prompt is built by concatenating the template literals, which include the variables like ${summary}, ${skills}, etc. But in the code, those variables are imported from templates.js. So in the prompt.js, the prompt is constructed correctly by inserting the template sections into the prompt string. That seems okay.

Wait, but in the prompt, the user is supposed to pass the resumeText, jobDescription, and relevantExperience. The prompt includes the resumeText between RESUME START and END. The jobDescription is in the jdPrompt block, and relevantExperience is in the rePrompt block. So the parameters are being used correctly.

Another thing to check: the system prompt. The system variable is imported from templates.js, which includes detailed instructions for the OpenAI model. That's correct.

Is there any other issue? Let me check the code again. The user mentioned that the backend API takes the inputs, combines with templates, sends to OpenAI, and returns the result. The buildPrompt function returns the system and user prompt, which probably are used in the OpenAI API call. The system prompt is part of the OpenAI messages, so that's correct.

Wait, but in the `prompt.js` code, the system variable is imported from templates.js, and then in the buildPrompt function, the return is { system, user: prompt }, which might be part of the OpenAI API parameters. That seems okay.

Another possible issue: the prompt structure. The user is supposed to generate the resume sections based on the instructions. However, the current prompt includes the template sections (like summary, skills, etc.) as part of the user message. That's correct because the templates define the specific instructions for each section.

Wait, but in the `prompt.js` code, the prompt variable is built with the user's instructions, followed by the resume text, then the Focus section, the organization of sections, and then the template sections. That might be redundant because the templates are the instructions for each section. The OpenAI model would receive the system prompt (from templates.js) and the user prompt, which includes the resume and the instructions. So the system prompt in templates.js is the main system message, and the user prompt includes the specific instructions for each section. That's correct.

Hmm, but looking at the system prompt in templates.js, it's a detailed instruction for the model on how to optimize the resume. Then, in the user's prompt in prompt.js, the template sections (summary, skills, etc.) are appended. Wait, no. The prompt variable in `prompt.js` includes the entire user message, which is passed to OpenAI. The system prompt is separate. So the system variable is the system message, and the user variable is the user message. That's correct.

Another thing: the user's code uses the variables jdPrompt and rePrompt, which are conditionally added. The code checks if jobDescription or relevantExperience exist, and if so, adds the corresponding blocks. But in the prompt, the Focus section has a line that says "- Aligning with keywords from the job description" only if jdPrompt is present. That's correct because if there's no job description, there's nothing to align with.

Wait, but in the current code, the Focus section's line for aligning keywords is only added if jdPrompt is truthy. However, the jdPrompt itself is added to the prompt only if jobDescription exists. So the line in Focus about aligning keywords is only present when jobDescription is provided, which is correct.

Another possible issue: the way the prompt is structured. The user message includes the resume text, job description, relevant experience, and then the section instructions. The model might need to have the instructions first, then the content. But the order here is: initial instructions, then job description block, relevant experience block, resume block, then the Focus points and section order. Then the section-specific instructions. Not sure if the order affects the model's performance, but functionally, the code is correct.

Wait, but in the `prompt.js` code, the prompt is built with the initial instructions, then the jdPrompt and rePrompt blocks, then the resume text, then the Focus section, the organization instructions, and then the template sections (summary, skills, etc.). The template sections are the actual instructions for each section. So the user message includes all those instructions. That should be okay.

Another thing: the user's code uses template literals with ${} to insert the variables. The templates.js exports those variables as strings. So when the prompt is built, the actual instructions from the templates are inserted. That's correct.

Is there any other issue? Let me check for possible errors. The certifications variable is now correctly imported, so that's fixed. The parameters jobDescription and relevantExperience are used in the prompt, so the second issue is resolved.

Wait, but in the prompt, the relevantExperience is referenced in the rePrompt block, which is added if it exists. Then, in the Focus section, the line says "- Highlighting experience relevant to this role" regardless of whether relevantExperience is provided. The user's code currently has that line as static. Maybe that's okay because even without additional relevantExperience, the model should highlight existing experience. The rePrompt block adds more context but the instruction to highlight relevant experience is always there. So the line in Focus is correct.

Another thing: the prompt includes the section headers (SUMMARY, SKILLS, etc.) in the user message, followed by the template instructions for each section. That should guide the model correctly.

I think the main issues have been addressed. Are there any other potential problems? Maybe edge cases, like if resumeText is empty, but the user's instructions mention sanitizing and validating incoming data, which should be handled elsewhere. The current code doesn't have validation, but according to the Copilot instructions, that's something to consider. However, the user hasn't mentioned any issues with validation yet. The question was about issues in the two files, so maybe that's beyond the current scope unless the code has obvious flaws.

Wait, the user's Copilot instructions mention sanitizing and validating all incoming data. The current buildPrompt function doesn't do any validation or sanitization. It just uses the parameters directly. So that's a potential issue. The function should check that the inputs are properly sanitized and validated. For example, if resumeText is not a string, or if jobDescription is a number, that could cause problems. Also, the security guidelines say to sanitize and validate incoming data. So this is a violation of the user's own instructions.

So the user's code currently doesn't sanitize or validate the inputs. According to their guidelines, this is a problem. The user might not have realized this. So the assistant should point this out as an issue.

Additionally, in the prompt, the Focus section has a line that's conditional on jdPrompt, which is correct. But the way the prompt is structured, the model might not be clear on the exact format. However, the user's code seems to follow the intended structure.

So the new issues are the lack of input validation and sanitization in the buildPrompt function. The user's security guidelines require this. The assistant should suggest adding input validation to ensure all parameters are strings, trimming whitespace, and handling empty values appropriately.

Another thing: the prompt includes the resumeText directly. If resumeText is very long, it might exceed token limits. But the user's instructions mention reviewing for potential memory or runtime bottlenecks. However, that's more about performance, and the current code doesn't handle that. But maybe that's a more advanced issue.

So the main issues now are:

1. Missing input validation and sanitization.
2. Possible
