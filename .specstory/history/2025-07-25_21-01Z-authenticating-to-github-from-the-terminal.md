# Authenticating to GitHub from the terminal (2025-07-25 21:01Z)

_**User**_

I'm doing some work for a client, and I need to push changes directly to the client's repo. How do I authenticate to github from the terminal?

_**Assistant**_

To authenticate to GitHub from the terminal for pushing changes, use one of these methods:

### 1. HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `repo` scope:
# Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Generate New Token

# When pushing, use the token as your password:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main
# When prompted for credentials:
# Username: <your-github-username>
# Password: <your-personal-access-token>
```

### 2. SSH Authentication
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair (if none exists):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add public key to GitHub:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy output and add to: Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH Key

# Use SSH URL for repo:
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

> **Security Note:**  
> - Never expose tokens in logs (use `git config credential.helper osxkeychain` to securely store credentials)  
> - Use dedicated tokens with minimal required scopes (`repo` for push access)  
> - Prefer SSH for better security and convenience
