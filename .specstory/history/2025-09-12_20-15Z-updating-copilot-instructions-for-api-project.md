# Updating Copilot instructions for API project (2025-09-12 20:15Z)

_**User (2025-09-12 20:18Z)**_

This api project, which was original focused on rewriting resumes, is now the central endpoint for client project. The seond project added creates and validates travel itineraries. You will update the `copilot-instructions.md` file to reflect the goals of the project which are no longer resume focused. Instead, focus on coding and development practices. The app itself is deployed on Vercel.

The `copilot-instructions.md` file has been updated to reflect the broader goals of the API project. It now describes the app as a central endpoint for multiple client features (including travel itinerary creation/validation and legacy resume rewriting), emphasizes coding and development practices, and notes Vercel deployment. All guidance is now focused on modular, maintainable code and best practices for extensible API development. 

Let me know if you need further changes or want to review the updated instructions.
