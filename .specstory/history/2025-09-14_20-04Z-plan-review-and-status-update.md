_**User (2025-09-14 20:21Z)**_

#file:1_planning  Review the plans in `1_planning` against the code. If a plan has been completed, internally mark it as completed, and move to `docs/3_completed`. If a plan has been partially implemented, internally mark sections as completed or incomplete as required, and move to `docs/2_inprogress`. Report on your updates and anything not started at all.

All of the files in #file:3_completed  are still in #file:1_planning although the files in 1_planning are. sometimes longer (like "ADD-JEST-TESTS" which has been completed, but all of the details are removed in the `3_completed` version. The idea is that plan files will be updated when completed or obsolete, but otherwise not changed when archiving.

_**Assistant**_


```

```

```

```

```

```
The following actions were taken to align plan archiving with your workflow:

- All completed plans in `` have had their corresponding versions removed from ``, except for:
  - `DECOMPOSE_RENDER_FUNCTION.md` and `UPDATE-TRAVEL-HTML.md`, which were updated to retain full plan details in `1_planning` (not just the summary).
