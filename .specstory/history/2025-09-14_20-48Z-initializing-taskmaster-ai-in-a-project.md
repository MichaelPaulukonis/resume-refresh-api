# Taskmaster-AI Initialization: Planning Required

Before initializing Taskmaster-AI in your project, you must follow the mandatory planning process described in `copilot-instructions.md`:

## Next Steps

1. **Check for a plan-file in `docs/plans/`**  
   - If a relevant plan-file exists, you can update it, create a new one, or proceed without one.
   - If none exists, you must create one or confirm you want to proceed without it.

**Plan-file requirements:**  
- Location: `docs/plans/`
- Naming: `NN.semantic-name.md` (e.g., `01.taskmaster-ai-integration.md`)
- Contents: Problem Statement, Requirements, Technical Approach, Implementation Steps, Testing Strategy, Risks & Mitigation, Dependencies

---

Would you like to:
- Create a new plan-file for Taskmaster-AI initialization,
- Update an existing one,
- Or proceed without a plan-file?

Please confirm your choice so I can continue.

Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project. This falls outside the mandatory planning requirements (as it is infrastructure _for planning_).

_**Assistant**_

It appears that Taskmaster-AI initialization requires a valid workspace folder to be open in VS Code. Please ensure your project folder is open as the workspace before continuing.

Once confirmed, I will proceed with integrating Taskmaster-AI for project planning and task management, including configuration and usage instructions. Let me know when your workspace is ready.
