# Taskmaster-AI Initialization: Planning Required

Before initializing Taskmaster-AI in this project, I must follow the mandatory planning process described in `copilot-instructions.md`:

- All feature requests or significant modifications must begin with a plan-file in `docs/plans/`.
- The plan-file should include: Problem Statement, Requirements, Technical Approach, Implementation Steps, Testing Strategy, Risks & Mitigation, Dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. Please confirm if you want to:
   - Create a new plan-file in `docs/plans/` for Taskmaster-AI initialization,
   - Update an existing relevant plan-file,
   - Or proceed without a plan-file (exception allowed by project policy).

Let me know your preference, and I will continue with the initialization process accordingly.

initialize taskmaster-ai into this project. This falls outside the mandatory planning requirements (as it is infrastructure _for planning_).

---

_**Assistant**_

Understoodâ€”since Taskmaster-AI initialization is infrastructure for planning, it is exempt from the mandatory plan-file process.

## Next Steps
I will:
- Add Taskmaster-AI configuration and setup files to the project.
- Ensure integration is modular and does not interfere with existing API logic.
- Document the setup for future maintainers.

Please specify:
- Do you want Taskmaster-AI as a local CLI, VS Code extension, or API integration?
- Any preferred configuration (e.g., directory, environment variables, authentication)?

If not specified, I will proceed with a standard local CLI setup and document the integration. Let me know if you have preferences, or I will begin with the default approach.

Use the mcp server to initialize the project.

---

_**Assistant**_

It appears that the MCP server cannot initialize Taskmaster-AI because the workspace folder is not properly opened in VS Code.

**Please open the main project folder (`resume-refresh-api`) in VS Code as your workspace.**  
Once the folder is open, I can proceed with the MCP server initialization for Taskmaster-AI.

Let me know when the workspace is ready, and I will continue setup immediately.

The MCP server cannot initialize Taskmaster-AI because the workspace folder is not properly opened in VS Code.

Please ensure that the main project folder (`resume-refresh-api`) is open as your workspace in VS Code.  
Once confirmed, I will proceed with the MCP server initialization for Taskmaster-AI.

Let me know when the workspace is ready, and I will continue setup immediately.

_**User (2025-09-14 21:08Z)**_

How is this NOT a workspace?

---

_**Assistant**_

Your folder structure and context indicate that `resume-refresh-api` is a valid workspace. The error is likely due to a technical limitation or miscommunication between the MCP server and VS Code regarding workspace detection.

You are working in ``, which is a proper project folder with source code, configuration, and environment files.

## Next Steps

I will proceed with the Taskmaster-AI initialization using the MCP server, treating your current folder as the workspace. If any further errors occur, I will provide a workaround or manual setup steps. There appears to be a persistent issue with MCP server workspace detection, despite your folder being a valid workspace.

**Workaround:**  
I can provide manual setup instructions or create the necessary Taskmaster-AI infrastructure files directly in your project.  
Would you like to proceed with a manual integration, or do you want to troubleshoot the MCP server workspace issue further?
