# Creating a Product Requirements Document for API (2025-09-14 21:14Z)

_**User (2025-09-14 21:16Z)**_

We need to create a product requirements document based on #file:example_prd.txt . Save it as `docs./reference/api_prd.md` Use #file:copilot-instructions.md #file:README.md the code in #file:api  #file:vercel.json and even #file:.specstory . Ask me about anything ambiguous or contradictory.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s the plan for creating your Product Requirements Document (PRD):

## Approach

- I’ll use the template in `example_prd.txt` and fill it out with details from:
  - Project context and rules in `copilot-instructions.md`
  - API features and deployment info from `README.md` and `vercel.json`
  - Source code in `` (resume and travel endpoints, supporting modules)
  - Any relevant history or issues from ``
- The PRD will be saved as `docs/reference/api_prd.md`.

## Clarifications Needed

Before I proceed, please confirm or clarify the following:

1. **Feature Scope:** Should the PRD cover only the current endpoints (resume refresh, travel itinerary), or also plan for future extensibility (e.g., new client features)?
2. **User Personas:** Is the primary user a job seeker, traveler, or both? Any other personas to include?
3. **Technical Stack:** Is OpenAI the only LLM provider, or should alternatives be considered for future-proofing?
4. **Security Requirements:** Any specific compliance or data privacy requirements beyond “zero trust” and not logging sensitive data?
5. **Deployment:** Is Vercel the only target, or should the PRD mention possible multi-cloud or on-prem deployment?
6. **Known Issues:** Should I include any open problems or lessons learned from `` history?

Let me know your preferences or any additional requirements. Once you confirm, I’ll generate and save the PRD.

1. Plan for future extensibility
2. Resume endpoints persona is a job seeker. Travel endpoints persona is a travel coordinator (not the traveler).
3. OpenAI is the current LLM provider. This is based on client's preference. 
4. Nothing specific.
5. Vercel is the only API target. Files inside of `html/` are fragments that are manually added to code-blocks inside of a Squarespace website.
6. Yes, if there are any.

The Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been created as `api_prd.md`, incorporating your clarifications and all relevant project context.

Let me know if you need any changes or want to review specific sections.

Why did you mark "Resume Rewriting" as "Legacy"

---

_**Assistant**_

I marked "Resume Rewriting" as "Legacy" because the copilot instructions and project context suggest it was the original feature and may have been superseded or supplemented by newer endpoints (like travel itinerary). If this is incorrect and resume rewriting is still a primary or actively developed feature, I can remove the "Legacy" label. Please confirm your preference.

_**User (2025-09-14 21:23Z)**_

It is still a primary feature. The API endpoint is being used for multiple client projects, based on their budget.

```

```
The PRD now clarifies that Resume Rewriting is a primary, actively used feature for multiple client projects. If you need further adjustments or want to review other sections, let me know.
