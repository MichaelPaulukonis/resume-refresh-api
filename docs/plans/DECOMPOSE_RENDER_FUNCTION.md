# Plan: Decompose and Test `renderParsedJsonAsHtml`

This document outlines the plan to refactor the `renderParsedJsonAsHtml` function in `api/travelService/service.js`. The goal is to improve readability, maintainability, and testability by breaking it down into smaller, single-responsibility functions and establishing a comprehensive suite of unit tests.

## Phase 1: Code Refactoring (Isolate the Change)

**Goal:** Decompose the function without altering its current behavior.

1.  **Create Helper Functions:** In `service.js`, create the following new, empty functions:
    *   `renderContactInfo(item)`
    *   `renderItemFooter(item)`
    *   `renderItem(item)`
    *   `renderCategorySection(categoryName, items)`
    *   `renderTopContactsSection(vcards)`

2.  **Migrate Logic:** Carefully move the corresponding HTML-building logic from the original `renderParsedJsonAsHtml` into each new, smaller function.

3.  **Orchestrate:** Update the main `renderParsedJsonAsHtml` function to call these new helper functions. Its role will be reduced to an orchestrator that assembles the final HTML from the results of the new functions.

4.  **Verification:** Run the existing test suite (`pnpm test`). The current snapshot tests for `parseResponse` must pass, proving that the refactoring has not introduced any regressions.

## Phase 2: Unit Testing (Build the Safety Net)

**Goal:** Create a granular suite of unit tests for the new components.

1.  **Create New Test File:** Create a new file at `api/travelService/service.render.test.js`.

2.  **Write Unit Tests:** For each new function created in Phase 1, add a corresponding `describe` block in the new test file.

3.  **Use Mock Data:** Within each `describe` block, write `it` blocks that test various scenarios using small, focused mock data objects. Do not rely on the large fixture files for these unit tests.

4.  **Test Scenarios:**
    *   Test the "happy path" with complete and valid data.
    *   Test edge cases with incomplete or missing data (e.g., an item with no contacts, an empty array of items).
    *   Test behavior with `null` or `undefined` inputs.

5.  **Snapshot Assertions:** Use `expect(result).toMatchSnapshot()` to assert the correctness of the generated HTML for each test. This will create a new `service.render.test.js.snap` file.

## Phase 3: Cleanup and Review

**Goal:** Review the refactored code for clarity and make final improvements.

1.  **Code Review:** Read through the new functions. Ensure names are clear and the logic is easy to follow.
2.  **Add Comments:** Add comments only where necessary to explain the *why*, not the *what*.
3.  **Final Verification:** Run the entire test suite one last time to ensure both the original tests and the new unit tests are passing.
