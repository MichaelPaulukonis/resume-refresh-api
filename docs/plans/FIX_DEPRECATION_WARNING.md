# Plan: Address `util._extend` Deprecation Warning

**Objective**: Identify and resolve the `DeprecationWarning: The 'util._extend' API is deprecated` that appears when running the development server.

### Steps to Resolve

1.  **Identify the Source Package**
    
    The warning originates from a dependency using the deprecated `util._extend` function. To find the specific package, you can use one of the following methods:

    *   **Method A: Search `node_modules`**
        
        Run the following command in the project root to search for the deprecated function call directly within your installed packages:
        ```sh
        grep -r "util._extend" node_modules
        ```

    *   **Method B: Use Node.js Trace Flag**
        
        Run the development server with the `--trace-deprecation` flag to get a full stack trace, which will point to the file and package using the function:
        ```sh
        node --trace-deprecation ./node_modules/.bin/vercel dev
        ```

2.  **Fix the Issue**

    Once you have identified the package, you have a few options:

    *   **Update the Package**: The simplest solution is often to update the package to a newer version, as the maintainers may have already fixed the deprecation. Run `pnpm up <package_name>`.
    *   **Find an Alternative**: If the package is no longer maintained, search for a modern replacement.
    *   **Contribute a Fix**: If it's an open-source project, consider submitting a pull request to the package repository that replaces `util._extend` with `Object.assign()`.
    *   **Suppress the Warning (Last Resort)**: If an immediate fix isn't possible, you can temporarily hide the warning by setting an environment variable. This is not recommended as it only masks the problem.
