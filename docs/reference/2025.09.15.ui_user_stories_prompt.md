I need help creating comprehensive user stories for changes to the  Travel Itinerary generator's UI. Please help me convert my requirements into well-written user stories with clear acceptance criteria.

The user stories will be written to a markdown file in `docs/user_stories/`

If anything is unclear, contradicts other documents, or ambiguous, ask me for clarification.

## Project Context:

- **Project Type**: html fragments and vercel-hosted node.js API
- **Target Users**: Travel Coordinator
- **Main Purpose**: Accepts travel details, generates and validates itineraries using OpenAI, and returns structured results
- **Key Features**: "Important" parts of the UI are readily viewable, while other portions are viewable with a click


## Requirements to Convert:

The current Travel Itinerary Display is 4 main sections:

1. Report Overview
2. Attractions/Venues/Events
3. Contact information (top 3)
4. Verification Report

In the UI (html frtagments) the verification report should be hidden (collapsed, or the like) by default.
Contact Information should NOT be the "top 3" - it should be a complete list of contacts.
In the UI, Contact Information should be collapsed by default.
The structured data returned from OpenAI (see `open_ai_response.js`) contains a "sources" section within the `meta` properties. This should be formatted into HTML and returned to become a 5th section in the UI


## User Story Creation Request:

Please create user stories that follow this structure:

### Story Format:
**As a** [user type]  
**I want** [functionality]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

### For each user story, please include:

#### 1. User Story Details
- Clear, concise story following the standard format
- Specific user persona (end user, admin, guest, etc.)
- Well-defined functionality or feature
- Clear business value or benefit

#### 2. Acceptance Criteria
- Specific, testable conditions that must be met
- Use "Given, When, Then" format where appropriate
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

#### 3. Story Specifications
- **Story Points/Effort**: Rough complexity estimate
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on business value
- **Dependencies**: Other stories that must be completed first
- **Definition of Done**: What constitutes completion

#### 4. Additional Details
- **Business Rules**: Any specific business logic requirements
- **Technical Notes**: Important technical considerations
- **UX/UI Requirements**: User experience requirements
- **Performance Criteria**: Any performance requirements

## User Story Categories:

Please organize stories into these categories:

### Epic Level Stories
- Large features that span multiple sprints
- High-level user goals and journeys
- Major system capabilities

### Feature Level Stories  
- Mid-sized functionality within an epic
- Complete user workflows
- Specific feature implementations

### Task Level Stories
- Small, specific pieces of functionality
- Individual screens or components
- Single user actions or interactions

## Story Examples:

For each story, provide examples like:

**User Story:**
As a registered user  
I want to reset my password via email  
So that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on the login page
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I receive a password reset email within 5 minutes
- Given I click the reset link in the email
- When I enter a new password (meeting requirements)
- Then my password is updated and I can log in
- Given the reset link is older than 24 hours
- When I try to use it
- Then I see an error message and can request a new link

## Additional Considerations:

Please ensure stories are:
- **Independent**: Can be developed and tested separately
- **Negotiable**: Can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Provide clear business value
- **Estimable**: Can be sized and planned
- **Small**: Can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Have clear acceptance criteria

## Story Refinement:
- Group related stories into epics
- Identify dependencies between stories
- Suggest story splitting for large stories
- Recommend prioritization based on value and dependencies

Focus on creating stories that are actionable, testable, and provide clear value to users.
