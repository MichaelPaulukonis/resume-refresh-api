I need help creating comprehensive user stories for Travel Itinerary generator's history feature. Please help me convert my requirements into well-written user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Use #file:api_prd.md #file:travel.html and #file:api as needed

## Project Context:

- **Project Type**: html fragments and vercel-hosted node.js API
- **Target Users**: Travel Coordinator
- **Main Purpose**: Accepts travel details, generates and validates itineraries using OpenAI, and returns structured results (a human-readable travel itinerary, a JSON itinerary, and a human-readable verification report)
- **Key Features**: Store and retrieve travel itinerary versions (both human-readable and JSON version. Verification reports I am not sure of)

## Requirements to Convert:

The travel itineraries need to be stored in a database and retrieved. Currently there is no api endpoints, no html interface, nor a database schema. On the Vercel host, I have created `carriage-house-db-00`, a MongoDB Atlas database. Based on the existing data that we capture for the travel itinerary (NOTE: this is ONLY for travel itineraries, NOT for resumes), help me develop the specs for a "history" store for travel itineraries. My idea is that the user (the travel coordinator) will select an existing itinerary, or start a new one. Itineraries will be organized by location and date, and have an optional name attached to them (eg. "Barcelona Nov 2025", "Pamplona Dec 2025 Argosy Group", "Atlanta Jan 2026 Behar Birthday"). For each separate itinerary we would store a snapshot of the output when generated. The user would be able to retrieve a specific version to work with. The user would be able to delete a specific version, or an entire itinerary.

## User Story Creation Request:

Please create user stories that follow this structure:

### Story Format:
**As a** [user type]  
**I want** [functionality]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

### For each user story, please include:

#### 1. User Story Details
- Clear, concise story following the standard format
- Specific user persona (end user, admin, guest, etc.)
- Well-defined functionality or feature
- Clear business value or benefit

#### 2. Acceptance Criteria
- Specific, testable conditions that must be met
- Use "Given, When, Then" format where appropriate
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

#### 3. Story Specifications
- **Story Points/Effort**: Rough complexity estimate
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on business value
- **Dependencies**: Other stories that must be completed first
- **Definition of Done**: What constitutes completion

#### 4. Additional Details
- **Business Rules**: Any specific business logic requirements
- **Technical Notes**: Important technical considerations
- **UX/UI Requirements**: User experience requirements
- **Performance Criteria**: Any performance requirements

## User Story Categories:

Please organize stories into these categories:

### Epic Level Stories
- Large features that span multiple sprints
- High-level user goals and journeys
- Major system capabilities

### Feature Level Stories  
- Mid-sized functionality within an epic
- Complete user workflows
- Specific feature implementations

### Task Level Stories
- Small, specific pieces of functionality
- Individual screens or components
- Single user actions or interactions

## Story Examples:

For each story, provide examples like:

**User Story:**
As a registered user  
I want to reset my password via email  
So that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on the login page
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I receive a password reset email within 5 minutes
- Given I click the reset link in the email
- When I enter a new password (meeting requirements)
- Then my password is updated and I can log in
- Given the reset link is older than 24 hours
- When I try to use it
- Then I see an error message and can request a new link

## Additional Considerations:

Please ensure stories are:
- **Independent**: Can be developed and tested separately
- **Negotiable**: Can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Provide clear business value
- **Estimable**: Can be sized and planned
- **Small**: Can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Have clear acceptance criteria

## Story Refinement:
- Group related stories into epics
- Identify dependencies between stories
- Suggest story splitting for large stories
- Recommend prioritization based on value and dependencies

Focus on creating stories that are actionable, testable, and provide clear value to users.
