- **Success Metrics**: Success is measured by user adoption, task completion rate, and qualitative feedback indicating significant time savings and improved workflow.

## 4. Target Users & Personas

- **Primary User Segment**: Professional Travel Coordinators.
- **User Persona**:
    - **Name**: Susan, Corporate Travel Coordinator.
    - **Demographics**: 45 years old, works for a mid-sized tech company, schedules travel for executive teams. She is tech-savvy but has no time for overly complex software.
    - **Goals**: To quickly and efficiently produce accurate, professional, and easy-to-read itineraries for her teams. She needs to be able to trust the information and verify it quickly.
    - **Pain Points**: Juggling multiple last-minute travel requests, finding reliable contact information, verifying pricing, and spending too much time formatting documents instead of coordinating logistics.
- **User Journey Mapping**:
    1. Susan receives a travel request for a team trip.
    2. She navigates to the webpage containing the Travel Itinerary component.
    3. She enters the destination, dates, group size, and a brief description of the travelers into the form.
    4. She clicks "Get My Travel Plan" and sees a clear loading indicator.
    5. The generated itinerary appears, with the main sections visible and secondary information (Verification, Contacts) collapsed.
    6. She reviews the main itinerary, then expands the Verification and Data Sources sections to cross-reference key details.
    7. Satisfied with the plan, she uses the "Copy to Clipboard" button to paste the text into an email or internal document for the traveling team.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### Core Features (MVP)

- **Itinerary Input Form**: A simple form for submitting destination, dates, group size, and traveler details.
- **API Integration**: Asynchronous communication with the `/api/travel` endpoint to send user input and receive the generated plan.
- **Loading State**: A clear visual indicator to inform the user that the itinerary is being generated.
- **Itinerary Display**: Renders the structured HTML response from the API.
- **Verification Report Display**: Renders the AI-generated verification report.
- **Collapsible Sections**: The Verification and Contact Information sections are collapsed by default to improve readability, with a toggle to show/hide them.
- **Complete Contact List**: Displays all contacts provided by the API, not just a "top 3" list.
- **Data Sources Display**: Renders a list of clickable source URLs used by the AI, providing transparency.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A button to copy the text content of the generated itinerary.

### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

(As defined in `docs/user_stories/02.travel-itinerary-ui-updates.md`)

#### Story: Collapse Verification Report by Default
- **As a** Travel Coordinator, **I want** the Verification Report section to be collapsed by default, **so that** I can focus on the primary itinerary details first and reduce initial visual clutter.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given a travel itinerary is generated, the "Verification" section content is initially hidden.
    - When the "Show" button is clicked, the verification report becomes visible and the button text changes to "Hide".

#### Story: Collapse Contact Information by Default
- **As a** Travel Coordinator, **I want** the Contact Information section to be collapsed by default, **so that** the main itinerary is more scannable.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given a travel itinerary is generated, the "Contact Information" section is initially hidden.
    - When expanded, the full list of contacts becomes visible.

#### Story: Display a Complete List of Contacts
- **As a** Travel Coordinator, **I want** to see a complete list of all contacts from the travel plan, **so that** I have all necessary contact information readily available.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given the API provides `contacts_vcards`, all contacts in the array are rendered in the "Contact Information" section.

#### Story: Display Data Sources
- **As a** Travel Coordinator, **I want** to see a formatted list of the data sources, **so that** I can understand where the information originated.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given the API response contains `meta.sources`, a new "Data Sources" section is displayed with each source as a clickable link.
    - If `meta.sources` is empty, the section is not displayed.

## 6. Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: The component is a self-contained HTML fragment with inline CSS and JavaScript. It must not have external dependencies that would complicate embedding.
- **Performance**: The UI must remain responsive while waiting for the API. The API call is asynchronous, and a loading indicator must be displayed during this time.
- **Security**: User-provided input is handled by the backend API, which is responsible for security and sanitization. The frontend component does not store any user data.
- **Integration**: The component depends entirely on the `/api/travel` endpoint of the Resume Refresh API for its functionality.

## 7. Design & UX Considerations

- **Key Design Principles**: Simplicity, clarity, and efficiency. The interface should be clean and uncluttered.
- **User Experience Goals**: A frictionless, single-page application experience. Generating a plan should be intuitive and require minimal steps. The output must be highly readable and well-organized.
- **Accessibility**: Form inputs must be associated with labels. Focus states for interactive elements must be clear. Content is structured semantically (e.g., using `<section>`, `<h2>`).

## 8. Success Metrics & KPIs

- **How Success is Measured**: Success is defined by high user satisfaction and a measurable reduction in the time and effort required to create itineraries.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
    - **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of users who successfully generate an itinerary after filling out the form.
    - **Adoption Rate**: Number of itineraries generated per week/month.
    - **Qualitative Feedback**: Direct feedback from Travel Coordinators on usability and time saved.

## 9. Timeline & Milestones

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Initial development of the HTML form, JavaScript logic for API communication, and basic display of the returned travel plan.
- **Phase 2 (Completed)**: UI/UX Enhancement. Implementation of collapsible sections for Verification and Contacts, rendering of the full contact list, and addition of the Data Sources section.
- **Dependencies**: The component is critically dependent on the availability and performance of the backend `/api/travel` endpoint.

## 10. Assumptions & Constraints

- **Assumptions**:
    - Users have the necessary trip details (destination, dates, etc.) before using the tool.
    - The backend API can return accurate and relevant data for a wide range of travel queries.
    - The host website environment supports modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- **Constraints**:
    - The component is stateless and does not store user history or preferences.
    - All complex logic and data processing is handled by the external API, not the client-side fragment.
    - Styling is intentionally minimal and self-contained to prevent conflicts with the host site's CSS.
- **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**:
    - **Risk**: The backend API is unavailable. **Mitigation**: The JavaScript includes error handling to display a user-friendly message.
    - **Risk**: The AI-generated data is inaccurate. **Mitigation**: The component presents a "Verification Report" and "Data Sources" section to empower the user to validate the information easily.
