## Epic Level Stories

### Epic 1: Travel Itinerary History Management
**User Story:**
As a Travel Coordinator  
I want to store, retrieve, and manage versions of travel itineraries  
So that I can efficiently track, update, and reuse travel plans for different trips

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have generated a travel itinerary
- When I choose to save it
- Then a snapshot of the itinerary (human-readable and JSON) is stored in the database
- Given I want to view past itineraries
- When I access the history interface
- Then I see a list organized by location, date, and optional name
- Given I select a specific itinerary version
- When I choose to retrieve it
- Then the correct version is loaded for review or editing
- Given I want to delete an itinerary or version
- When I confirm deletion
- Then the selected item is removed and cannot be retrieved

**Story Points/Effort:** 13  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Database setup, API endpoints for CRUD operations  
**Definition of Done:**
- All CRUD operations for itinerary history are implemented and tested
- UI allows selection, retrieval, and deletion
- Data is organized by location, date, and name

**Business Rules:**
- Only Travel Coordinators can access history features
- Each itinerary must have a unique combination of location, date, and name
- Deletion is irreversible

**Technical Notes:**
- Use MongoDB Atlas (`carriage-house-db-00`) for storage
- Store both human-readable and JSON versions
- API endpoints must be stateless and secure

**UX/UI Requirements:**
- Simple, searchable list interface
- Confirmation dialogs for deletion
- Clear error messages for missing or duplicate entries

**Performance Criteria:**
- Retrieval and save operations complete within 2 seconds
- UI can handle 100+ itineraries without lag

## Story Refinement & Grouping
- Epic 1 contains all features and tasks for itinerary history.
- Feature 1.1 (Save), 1.2 (Retrieve), 1.3 (Delete) are sequential and depend on schema/API setup.
- Task 1.4.1 depends on all API endpoints being available.
- Recommend splitting Epic 1 into smaller sprints if needed.
- Prioritize Save and Retrieve features for MVP; Delete and UI updates can follow.

## Next Steps
- Use these stories for planning, implementation, and testing.
